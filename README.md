This wonderful script helps me to automate setting of various meta parameters for my m4v files.
Initial version works only with `TV Show` media kind, it season number and artwork.

	Usage:
	metasetter TvShowName SeasonNumber ArtworkPath
	Example:
	metasetter "House M.D." 1 "\Users\greg\Pictures\covers\housemd-1.png"

Requirements

It is required to install [SublerCLI](http://code.google.com/p/subler/) and set full path to SublerCLI executable in the `configuration` section of script.
